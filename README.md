## Biomechanics arm/body forces simulation program

# This branch is currently a work in progress
### Working on combining code

The following packages are needed in order to run this in python:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- mediapipe
- opencv-python
- tkinter
- pillow

To run the program, go into the `realtime_demo` folder (after downloading/cloning this repo) from a terminal emulator/shell (e.g. `cmd` on Windows, `bash` on Linux), install the listed packages, and run the program via `python gui.py`
