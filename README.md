This repo is a work in progress, and is primarily used for server-based (GitHub) storage of the project files for easier management.

## Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this project is to 1. generate accurate three dimensional motion tracking using only data from two dimensional motion tracking entirely derived from a regular video taken from a webcam, and 2. use the three dimensional time series data to demonstrate the forces involved in the movement of the human arm, for use in a classroom physics demonstration.
The 2D motion tracking data will be generated by the FOSS software "FreeMoCap", using only a regular laptop webcam.
The 3D motion tracking data will be extrapolated from the output of "FreeMoCap" using a custom algorithm designed for these purposes.

## Current status:
- Successfully able to generate (fairly) accurate 3D motion tracking data as previously described
- Currently working through ensuring the accuracy and strength of the foundational aspects of the use of the physics equations being used for approximating body force distributions based on the tracking data.
